# Summarize Findings

List, in very brief bullet points, everything we learned to do and NOT to do based on our conversation.

Format:

- ✅ Short actionable lesson
- ❌ Short actionable mistake to avoid

Append new findings to the end of an existing "now we know" list if provided.

No extra explanation—just the list.
