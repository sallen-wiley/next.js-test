## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application

4. Run Storybook for component development:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view the Storybook interface.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm run start` - Start the production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality
- `npm run storybook` - Start Storybook development server
- `npm run build-storybook` - Build Storybook for production
- `npm run chromatic` - Deploy to Chromatic for visual testing

## Key Technologies

- **Next.js 15.3.2** - React framework with App Router
- **React 19** - Latest React with concurrent features
- **Material-UI v7** - React component library
- **Emotion** - CSS-in-JS styling
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Storybook** - Component development and documentation
