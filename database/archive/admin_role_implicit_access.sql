-- Migration: Admin Role Implicit Access
-- Description: This migration documents the decision to grant admins implicit access 
-- to all manuscripts through application logic rather than explicit database records.
--
-- NO DATABASE CHANGES REQUIRED
--
-- Implementation Details:
-- - Admins see all manuscripts without user_manuscripts junction records
-- - Query-level filtering checks user_profiles.role = 'admin' before applying user_manuscripts joins
-- - This prevents database bloat and provides automatic access to new manuscripts
-- - Real manuscript assignments (editor, author, collaborator, reviewer) remain explicit
--
-- Benefits:
-- 1. No need to create/maintain admin assignment records for every manuscript
-- 2. New manuscripts are instantly visible to admins without intervention
-- 3. Clear separation: app role (admin) vs manuscript role (editor/author/etc)
-- 4. Audit trail preserved - only real assignments stored in user_manuscripts
-- 5. Flexible UI - can show "Viewing as Admin" indicators
--
-- Modified Functions (application layer only):
-- - getUserManuscripts() - Returns all manuscripts for admins
-- - getManuscriptById() - No user check for admins
