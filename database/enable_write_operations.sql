-- Note: These policies ensure that only users with admin or designer roles can:
-- 1. Create new manuscripts/reviewers
-- 2. Update existing records
-- 3. Delete records
-- 
-- All users can still read data (via existing read policies)
-- The is_active = true check ensures only active users can perform write operations
